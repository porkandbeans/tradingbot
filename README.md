interact with my bot at https://steamcommunity.com/id/gokritz_bot

This is the source code for my trading bot that I'm putting up on github for potential employers, or curious individuals.

This requires node.js and some packages from the repo.
```
npm install steam-user steam-totp backpacktf
```

I aim to earn some profit by eventually setting up monero transactions with this bot, and then buying/selling keys for XMR (in addition to refined metal trades)
